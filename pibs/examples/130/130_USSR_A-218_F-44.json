	"Description": "Ballistics of the 130mm F-44, ZS-44 and the ZS-44P rounds fired from A-217, A-218, and the A-222 \"Bereg\" gun mounts. Shell loads 3.56 kg of HE filler. Cartridge loads 10 kg of 15/7 BP propellant, with reduced propellant force, roughly 905 kJ/kg.\n\nWork on the A-217 single-mount automatic gun started in 1967, and received the factory index ZIF-92 in 1969. Intended as the armament for Project 1135 Burevestnik class guard ship, it exceeded the weight allowance and was ultimately rejected. However, the same ballistics was reused for the twin automatic mount A-218 (factory index ZIF-94). Initially entering service with the Project 956 Sarych class, it was accepted for service in 1985 as the AK-130. It would also arm ships of the Project 1144 \"Orlan\" class and the Project 1164 \"Slava\" class.\n\nBarrel length is 6990 mm, cartridge (total) length is 1364-1369 mm. Cartridge length is estimated at 770 mm from pixel measurement, pending authoratative sources. Projectile travel estimated at 6220 mm. Chambrage is estimated.
