	"Description": "Ballistics of 30x155mm rounds fired from the NR-30 autocannon. Originally specified for 2,000 rounds of service life, this was improved to 2,400 in 1971 and 3,000 rounds in 1986. Barrel length measures 1600mm, gun is fired at 850-1000 rpm. \n\nThe NR-30 is produced in PRC as the type 30-1 autocannon. An improved version was developed in PRC as the type 30-3 autocannon, accepted in 1974.\nUSSR PRC    design    p.m. c.m. r.\n                      g    g    \nOFZ  WB620P HEI(SD)   410  95   \n     WB607P HEI\nOFZT WB624P HEIT(SD)  418  95   tracing distance out to 1,200 m\n     WB609P HEIT\nBR   WB606P APHEI(SD) 415  94   blunt nose with windscreen\nFor all rounds, the muzzle velocity specification is 780 (±10) m/s. This entry is constructed based on the original series of ammunition developed for the NR-30 in 1954. A new series of ammunition with streamlined aeroballistics was developed in 1974 in the USSR, characterized by reduced projectile mass (~405g).\n\nLoads 94-95 grams of 5/7 High Nitration. Grain of 7-perforated tubular geometry, web measures 0.58-0.65 mm, perforation diameter 0.15-0.25 mm, length 3.9-4.3 mm. Develops 3050 kgf/cm^2 breech pressure. Chambrage is approximated as 1.5 based on cartridge interior depth of 110mm. Resistance factor is fitted to yield the correct performance.",
