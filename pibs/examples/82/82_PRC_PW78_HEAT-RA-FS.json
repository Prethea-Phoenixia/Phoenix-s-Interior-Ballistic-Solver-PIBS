	"Description": "Ballistics of the WH-314 rocket assisted, fin-stabilized HEAT projectile fired from the 82mm Type 78 recoilless rifle, later designated PW78 (炮无78). Projectile consists of a conical nose section containing the fuze, an inline full diameter combustion chamber with four nozzles (angled 15° off shot axis), a central ignition tube containing 26 gram of No.3 blackpowder and the primer, onto which a four-blade turbine (30° off axis) holds the burst plate. Four fins, angled at 7.5°, attach at the mid of the ignition tube. \n\nProjectile contains 0.465 kg double-based leaded propellant, generates 208 m/s in 0.26-0.3 seconds, burnout at 460 m/s, ~150m down range. Ignition 0.133s (+/-0.015s) after muzzle exit, ~40m down range, delay is pyrotechnical (blackpowder). Upon firing, the turbine spins the projectile to 1100 RPM at the muzzle. The offset nozzle, fins, and turbine spins the projectile up to 2600-2700 RPM at burnout, improving accu. Production accepted in 1983 as WH314. Certified penetration is 150mm/65° (P>90%). The interquartile range on the horizontal and vertical axis at 100 meters down range is 0.45 m by 0.45 m.\n\nProjectile weighs 3.67 kg, loads 0.6 kg of double-based, strip grain 55-10x235. Develops 252 m/s from a peak breech pressure of 740 kgf/cm^2. Chamber measures 1.648 L, length of 2.45 dm, cross section of the barrel of 0.5281 dm^2, rear of the chamber measures 0.6648 dm^2, throat cross section of 0.3564 dm^2. Projectile starts at 150 kgf/cm^2, with a travel of 9.15 dm.\n\nImproved variants with identical ballistics includes the Type 78 82mm Type-1 HEAT round, accepted in 1987 as the WB156, certified penetration is 150mm/68° (P>90%) with \"sufficient\" post-pen effects. The Type 78 82mm Type-2 HEAT round improved penetration to 180mm/68° (P>90%).\n\nPressure is treated as copper crusher gauge and converted accordingly.",
