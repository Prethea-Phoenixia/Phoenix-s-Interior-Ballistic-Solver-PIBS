	"Description": "Ballistics of 100x695mmR 3UBM7 round with the 3BM19 APFSDS projectile, for use with the tank gun D-10. Although ballistically identical, the round is forbidden from use on BS-3 gun due to presence of muzzle device. The round/projectile 3UBM7/3BM19 and 3UBM8/3BM20 were adopted in 1976, although production examples of 1974-1975 were known. Cartridge loads a mix of 12/7 and 16/1, mass ratio is estimated. Weight is 5.8 kg for copper cartridge, or 5.9 kg for steel cartridge. \n\nThe 3UBM7/3UBM8 are identical except for the projectile. The 3BM19 projectile is a monolithic steel penetrator, while the 3BM20 projectile contains a VN-8 tungsten-carbide penetrator of 170g sheathed in a blunt head steel rod, with a sharp aerodynamic cap.",
