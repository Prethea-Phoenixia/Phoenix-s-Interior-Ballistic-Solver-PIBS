	"Description": "Ballistics of the 3UBK8 110x910mmR round with the 3BK16 \"Kadet\" HEAT-FS projectile, fired from the T-12 and MT-12 anti-tank guns. Developed alongside \"Zmeya\" for 115mm U-5TS and \"Ikra\" for 100mm D-10 gun, this round was introduced in the 1970s. Employs the V-15 piezoelectric base-detonating fuze.\n\nLoads 5.5 kg of 13/1 DG-3 grains. Projectile travel estimated from a gun length of 6650 mm, chamber length 913 mm, and a measured length of 345 mm for the breech. Velocity is reported as 1075 m/s from secondary sources. Projectile inset approximately 70 mm into cartridge case, 0.55 L deducated from chamber volume.\n\nThe ballistics of this entry is interchangeable among the following shots:\nRound   Proj.
