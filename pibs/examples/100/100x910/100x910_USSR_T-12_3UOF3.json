	"Description": "Ballistics of the 3UOF3 110x910mmR round with the 3OF15 HE-Frag-FS projectile, fired from the T-12 and MT-12 anti-tank guns. The 3OF15 round was originally issued with the T-12 gun, loading 2.234 kg of TNT. This was supplemented in service with the 3UOF12 round with the 3OF35 shell, which is identical except for the use of a 2.538 kg A-IX-2 filler.\n\nLoads 3.785 kg of 13/1 DG-3 grains. Tabulated velocity is 700 m/s. Projectile travel estimated from a gun length of 6650 mm, chamber length 913 mm, and a measured length of 345 mm for the breech. Projectile inset 1.35 dm into cartridge case, 1.06 L deducated from case volume.",
