	"Description": "Ballistics of the M309 (T38) HE round fired from the US 75x408mm M20 (T21) recoilless rifle, produced in the PRC as the WB015P fired from the Type 56 recoilless rifle, respectively. Projectile is rotationally stabiilized. Loads 0.65 kg of explosives.\n\nWB015P projectile weighs 6.1 kg, loads 1.45 kg of 9/14 high-nitrogen, potassium propellant. Develops 310 m/s from a peak breech pressure of 510 kgf/cm^2 (56 MPa). Chamber volume is 3.647 L and measures 3.12 dm long, 2.14 dm^2 at the rear. Nozzle throat measures 0.2748 dm^2. Projectile travels 16.54 dm in bore at a cross section of 0.4532 dm^2. Projectile drag coefficient in relation to 1943 drag curve i_43 = 1.05. One-piece cartridge weighs 8.806 kg, welded cartridge weighs 9.17 kg. Per 火炮内弹道计算手册 and 炮弹火箭弹手册. Pressure is interpreted as copper crusher gauge values.\n\nPer AMCP 706-238: Engineering Design Handbook: Recoilless Rifle Weapon Systems, M309A1 employs M10 propellant and develops 10ksi (68.95 MPa). Chamber volume is given as 286 in³ (4.69 L), which includes the expansion chamber that around the perforated cartridge. Nozzle expansion ratio given as 2.07, chamber cross section to throat area given as 1.49.\n\nGiven limited information, a compromise approach employing available information from both sources was employed.",
