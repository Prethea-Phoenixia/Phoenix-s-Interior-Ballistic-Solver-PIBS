	"Description": "Ballistics of the 125mm Step-2 Tungsten APFSDS round for use on weapons of the D-81 family, including the ZPT-98-125. \n\nThe performance target for the second phase of Project 123 was intended to be met with a TEGDN (太根) based charge design, propelling the second phase APFSDS projectile. However, during development, it was realized that the TEGDN under consideration suffers from poor low temperature mechanical strength. Consequently, this charge design utilizing high-nitration nitrocellulose was developed in parallel, as a backup. It ultimately proved unnecessary, and was therefore not adopted.\n\nProjectile: 125-2 7.44 kg\nCharge: 9.24 kg High Nitration Nitrocellulose (1046.4 kJ/kg computed, 1029.7 kJ/kg measured)\n - Main:        6.00 kg 16/19 Rosette\n - Incremental: 3.24 kg\n  - 2.54 kg 16/19 Rosette\n  - 0.7  kg 19/1-30\nCombustible Cartridge: 1.6 kg TNT impregnated nitrocellulose\n                              754   kJ/kg (as computed)\n                              686.5 kJ/kg (as measured)\nAs tested: [Pressure is copper crusher gauge]\nTemperature  Pmcp       Velocity\n-40°C        439.1 MPa  1678.1 m/s  \n 15°C        485.2 MPa  1727.9 m/s \n 50°C        519.3 MPa  1770.3 m/s\nReference:\n王建政，《高氮量单基发射药用于穿甲弹（二步）的装药设计与研究》，兵器工业集团第三事业部\n郑泽义，田书春《125mm坦克炮穿甲弹装药结构设计特点与分析》，国营第845厂",
